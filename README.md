# Analyzing-Data-Science-Survey-Results
In this project, a dataset containing responses to a Data Science Worker Survey was analyzed. The dataset was initially loaded into PowerBI and then looked through using Power Query. During this phase of the project, I noted down the major categories of information I was looking to later visualize, to avoid having to transform every column in the dataset and having to leave some out at the end. 

I focused in on the Salary, Job Title, Ethnicity, Age, and the Survey Taker's Favourite Programming Language. The other attributes of the dataset were disregarded as the dashboard would become too clutered with excess information.

After these columns were transformed, I had created the various visualizations.
These included:
- Pie Graph representing the proportions of different ethnicities employed in the field
- A stacked bar chart to represent favourite programming language, arranged by the respondant's job title
- A bar chart showing average salary by Job Title
- Info Card showing the number of survey respondants
- Info card showing the average age of the respondants
- A map showing where the survey respondants are located/working around the world

The dataset used to create this visualization is in the data sub-folder of this repository. The visualization file can be downloaded and viewed.
